\section{Experimental Setup}

In recent years, the intersection of robotics and agriculture has garnered significant attention due to its potential to revolutionize farming practices and address various challenges in crop cultivation and management. One of the critical issues faced by farmers worldwide is the proliferation of weeds in agricultural fields, which not only compete with crops for essential resources but also pose significant threats to livestock health and food safety. In particular, weeds such as Rumex have been identified as major nuisances in grasslands, where their presence can contaminate forage intended for grazing animals, including cows.
