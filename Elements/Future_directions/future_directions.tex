The following future research directions are proposed to address key challenges and capitalize on opportunities for improvement:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Enhanced Obstacle Avoidance: } The current obstacle avoidance strategy in the behavioral approach primarily focuses on checking obstacles during the generation of straight paths, potentially resulting in trajectories that approach the corners of obstacles. To address this limitation, an advanced obstacle avoidance methodology could be implemented, integrating obstacle checking directly into the Dubins path generation phase. This enhancement would involve seamlessly incorporating obstacle detection and avoidance mechanisms throughout the trajectory planning process. By doing so, the algorithm would yield smoother and more efficient paths, particularly in environments characterized by intricate obstacle layouts, while ensuring avoidance of obstacle corners.
    
    \item \textbf{Dynamic Obstacle Adaptation: } Extending the behavioral approach to dynamically adapt to moving obstacles presents an exciting avenue for future research. While the current implementation successfully generates grids for static obstacles, enhancing the algorithm to account for dynamic obstacles would require associating grids with other robots or moving objects whose positions are known. By integrating real-time sensor data and predictive modeling techniques, the algorithm could dynamically adjust its trajectory to avoid collisions with moving obstacles, thus enabling multi-robot coordination and dynamic obstacle avoidance in agricultural and other environments.
    
    \item \textbf{Sensor-Based Obstacle Avoidance: } Leveraging sensor data for obstacle detection and avoidance represents another promising direction for enhancing the behavioral approach. By integrating sensors such as LiDAR or cameras, the algorithm can detect obstacles in its environment and autonomously navigate around them. In scenarios where moving obstacles with unknown positions are encountered, an automatic grid generation mechanism could be employed to guide the robot away from potential collision points. This sensor-based approach offers increased adaptability and robustness, enabling the algorithm to effectively navigate complex and dynamic environments.
    
    \item \textbf{Generalization to Other Planning Problems: } Beyond its application in coverage path planning, the behavioral approach holds potential for addressing a broader range of planning problems. Given its efficient computational performance and adaptive nature, slight modifications to the algorithm could render it suitable for tasks such as trajectory planning, path optimization, and path following in various domains. Leveraging the algorithm's inherent flexibility and scalability opens avenues for exploring its applicability to various planning challenges, thereby driving the advancement of autonomous systems in agriculture and beyond.
