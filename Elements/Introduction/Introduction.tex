\section{Introduction}

In recent years, the intersection of robotics and agriculture has garnered significant attention due to its potential to revolutionize farming practices and address various challenges in crop cultivation and management. One of the critical issues faced by farmers worldwide is the proliferation of weeds in agricultural fields, which not only compete with crops for essential resources but also pose significant threats to livestock health and food safety. In particular, weeds such as Rumex have been identified as major nuisances in grasslands, where their presence can contaminate forage intended for grazing animals, including cows.

The purity of grassland vegetation directly impacts the nutritional quality of forage consumed by livestock, thereby influencing the health and productivity of animals. The ingestion of contaminated forage, tainted with toxic or harmful weed species like Rumex, can lead to adverse health effects in cattle, affecting milk quality and quantity, as well as overall animal welfare. Therefore, the effective removal of weeds, particularly Rumex, from grasslands is imperative to ensure the integrity and safety of livestock feed, as well as the sustainability of agricultural operations.

In response to this pressing agricultural challenge posed by weed infestation in grasslands, this thesis endeavors to pioneer the development and implementation of an innovative coverage path planning (CPP) algorithm. Unlike conventional approaches, this algorithm prioritizes straight paths to optimize energy efficiency, thereby offering versatility across a spectrum of coverage path planning methodologies. While its primary application lies in weed removal within grasslands, its adaptability extends to diverse agricultural contexts, promising enhanced efficiency and sustainability in autonomous robotic operations. CPP plays a crucial role in guiding autonomous robotic systems to systematically traverse and cover an entire area of interest while minimizing overlap and maximizing efficiency. By leveraging advancements in robotics, artificial intelligence, and sensing technologies, CPP algorithms can enable autonomous agricultural robots to navigate complex terrain, identify weed-infested areas, and perform targeted weed removal tasks with precision and efficacy.

The primary objective of this research is to develop a coverage path planning (CPP) algorithm tailored for the intelligent and systematic removal of Rumex weeds from grasslands, thereby promoting the production of high-quality forage and safeguarding the health of grazing animals. This algorithm aims to optimize coverage efficiency, ensuring that all targeted weeds are effectively identified and removed by the robotic system. Through the integration of advanced robotics algorithms, the proposed approach seeks to enhance the efficacy of weed management practices while minimizing reliance on chemical herbicides and manual labor.
