\subsection{Comparison with other approaches.}

In this section, we will conduct a comparative analysis of the proposed complete coverage path planning (CCP) algorithm against two alternative approaches: the lawnmower approach, which serves as the baseline for this thesis, and the graph search approach. The comparison will be conducted under the same experimental conditions described in the simulation section, utilizing identical datasets and performance metrics to ensure consistency and fairness in evaluation.

Simulation Setup
As with the initial simulations, the setup is designed to emulate the operational environment of an agricultural field. The same datasets used in the evaluation of the proposed CCP algorithm will be employed here to facilitate a direct comparison. These datasets are characterized by different point distributions and densities, ensuring a comprehensive assessment of each approachâ€™s performance.

The key performance metrics for comparison include:

Computational Time
Field Operation Time
Total Path Length
Number of Turns
Energy Consumption
Coverage Efficiency


These metrics will provide a detailed view of each algorithm's efficiency, effectiveness, and overall robustness.

Lawnmower Approach
The lawnmower approach, often referred to as the boustrophedon path, is a widely used baseline method in coverage path planning. It involves the robot traversing the field in parallel lines, akin to a lawnmower, ensuring that the entire area is covered systematically. This method is straightforward but may not be optimal in terms of path length and energy consumption, particularly in fields with irregular plant distributions or obstacles.

Graph Search Approach
The graph search approach utilizes a graph-based representation of the field, where points of interest (weeds and cluster of weeds, in this context) are treated as nodes, and paths between them are edges. Algorithms such as A* or Dijkstra's can be employed to find an optimal path that covers all nodes following the non-holonomic constraints. However, this apprach does not guarantee 
prioritization of approximate straight paths but guarantee respect non-holonomic constraints.

Performance Metrics
The performance metrics for all datasets and approaches will be summarized in tables and visualized in figures below. These metrics will provide a comprehensive view of each algorithm's performance under different scenarios, enabling a detailed comparison of their efficiency and effectiveness. The results will be analyzed to identify the strengths and weaknesses of each approach, facilitating an informed decision on the most suitable method for complete coverage path planning in agricultural fields.

The lawnmover approach and behavioral approach was performed on the same device. However, the graph search approach was performed on a different device with the following specifications:
11th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-1165G7 @ 2.80GHz

8 Cores

32GB RAM
