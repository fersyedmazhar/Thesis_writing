\subsection{Simulation Setup}


The simulation setup is meticulously designed to emulate the real-world operational environment of an agricultural field, ensuring that the algorithm's performance can be rigorously tested under realistic conditions. The global coverage path planning is initially performed using Matplotlib, followed by testing in a simulation environment leveraging the Robot Operating System (ROS) and the Gazebo simulator.

In the context of coverage path planning for agricultural fields, it is crucial to account for varying plant distributions. Therefore, different datasets are used to represent diverse scenarios, with the aim of assessing the algorithm's robustness under varying initial conditions and plant distributions. Specifically, the simulation setup incorporates different datasets with the same initial position and orientation of the robot to demonstrate the algorithm's adaptability.

Dataset Description
To comprehensively evaluate the algorithm, six distinct datasets are employed within the flat field of 120m x 120m area, with each dataset containing different numbers of points: 250, 500, 2000, 4000, 6000, and 10,000. Each primary dataset is further subdivided into four sub-datasets, characterized by different spatial distributions:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Random Distribution: Points are distributed randomly throughout the field.
    \item Clustered Distribution (4 Clusters): 20\% of the points are distributed randomly, while 80\% are distributed in four clusters with distinct Gaussian distribution variances.
    \item Clustered Distribution (6 Clusters): 20\% of the points are distributed randomly, with the remaining 80\% distributed in six clusters, each with distinct means and variances.
    \item Clustered Distribution (10 Clusters): Similar to the previous sub-datasets, 20\% of the points are randomly distributed, and 80\% are in ten clusters, each characterized by unique Gaussian distribution parameters.
\end{itemize}

This results in a total of 24 different datasets, meticulously crafted to test the algorithm's robustness across various scenarios, including variations in the number of points, their distribution patterns, the number of clusters, and the statistical properties of these clusters. Such comprehensive testing ensures that the algorithm is robust and adaptable to real-world agricultural environments, where plant distributions can significantly vary.
